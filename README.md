##Design Proposal

ZMA Omacs - Emacs in OCaml.

We want to make an ocaml-based extensible, customizable text editor - and more. At its core will be an interpreter for OCaml, a dialect of the [ML programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language) with extensions to support text editing. The features of Omacs include:

* Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a variety of file types including plain text, source code, and HTML.

* Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new users.

* Full [Unicode](http://unicode.org) support for nearly all human languages and their scripts.

* Highly customizable, using OCaml code or a graphical interface.

* A large number of extensions that add other functionality, including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger interface, calendar, and more. Many of these extensions are distributed with ZMA Omacs; others are available separately.
